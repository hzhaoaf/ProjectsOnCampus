This repository is a collection of some coding programs on campus. In order to keep record of them, I added them to my Github. The following is just a general introduction. If you are interested in any of these projects, you can read pull the code and run it.

ColorMaze is mobile game on J2ME platform. It is a puzzled game, in which the user need to fulfill a 4*4 grid with a dropper. 

Faster and IYo are both apps on Android platform. I wrote them out of interest. 

The Faster is a game challenged the capability of reaction, which has three models. 

The IYo is an experimental project, which I wrote it with my classmates. This app was aimed to help students to identify the different buildings on campus using the pattern recognition and Baidu map API. However, we finally just finished the demo because of the limited time.
